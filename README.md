## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- TensorFlow 2.5 or above
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arin2021/NLP
cd sentiment-analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```


3. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Dataset

The IMDb movie reviews dataset is used for training and testing the model.

## Usage

Run the `sentiment_analysis.py` script to train the sentiment analysis model and visualize the training process:


## Results

- The model achieved 85% accuracy on the test set.
- Training and validation accuracy can be visualized using Seaborn.
- A confusion matrix heatmap displays model predictions.
